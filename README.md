## Data Structures Overview
<details>
    <summary><strong>Array</strong> </summary>
    
## Array

- A list of similar values
- Can be used to store anything
- Stores values of the same data type
- Every item in an array is called an **element**
- 3 attributes:
    - Name
    - Type
    - Size
        - set integer that is fixed upon the creation of an array
        - **CAN'T** be changed once created
- Parallel arrays
    - 2 or more arrays which
        - contain the same # of elements
        - have corresponding values in the same position
- Creating an array
    - populate with elements
    - set a specific size
    - Python - array = [1, 2, 3]
- To get information, we use a **numerical index**
    - An integer which corresponds to an element within the array
- A two-dimensional array is an array with an array at each index

    <summary><strong>Stack</strong> </summary>
    
## Stack

- A data structure in which we add elements and remove elements according to the LIFO (last in first out) principle
    - only one way in and one way out for the data
- Common Stack Methods
    - push - adds an object into the top of the stack (Push(Object))
    - pop - remove an element from the top of the stack (Pop())
    - peek - allows you to get the value at the top of the list without removing it
    - contains - searching throughout the stack (Contains(Object)) - w/o having to take elements off the stack

    <summary><strong>Queue</strong> </summary>
    
## Queue

- The sequential access data structure which follows the FIFO methodology (First In First Out)
- Add to the back and remove from the front
- Queue methods
    - Enqueue - Adds element to the tail of the queue
    - Dequeue - Removes element from the head of the queue
    - Peek - returns the object that's at the forefront of the queue without removing it
    - Contains - returns whether or not the queue contains an object (boolean)
